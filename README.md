## PART 1 - KNN Algorithm : 
* For question 1.1 and 1.2, run the file called **KNN.py** using the following command: `python KNN.py` as it is.
* For question 1.6, commment line numbers 74 and 75 and uncomment line numbers 77 and 78 in **KNN.py**. Then, run the file using the following command: `python KNN.py`

## PART 2 - Decision Trees : 
* For question 2.1 to 2.5, run the file called **dTrees_InfoGain.py** using the following command: `python dTrees_InfoGain.py` as it is.

## PART 3 - Extra Credit 1 : 
* For question 3.1 to 3.4, run the file called **dTrees_Gini.py** using the following command: `python dTrees_Gini.py` as it is.

## PART 4 - Extra Credit 2 : 
We use Gini Criterion for this: 
* For question 4.1 to 4.4, uncomment the lines 36 to 39 in **dTrees_Gini.py**
* Then run this file using the following command: `python dTrees_Gini.py` as it is.
